The Challenge
During sprint planning, you have chosen to tackle the following task cards written for the upcoming sprint to test a new product concept:

EPIC
As a Product Owner,
I want to be able to create a 2D interactive story application with 4 unique scenes,
So that I can tell the first story in a series of stories about buttons, light bulbs, levers, and machines for children ages 3-8.

============================
User Story #1
As a reader,
I want to see a scene that shows a light bulb and a button and when I press the button, the button will animate and play a sound. After the sound plays, the light bulb should turn to an “on” state,
So that I can have an element in the scene that encourages repeated interaction.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given that I am viewing the scene,
When I touch the button,
Then the button should animate and play a sound and after the sound plays the light bulb turns on.

============================

User Story #2
As a reader,
I want to see another scene that shows a door and a door knob and when I press the door knob, the door knob animates and plays a sound. After the sound plays, the door should open,
So that I can have an element in the scene that encourages repeated interaction.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given that I am viewing the scene,
When I touch the door knob,
Then the door knob animates and plays a sound and after the sound plays the door opens.

============================

User Story #3
As a reader,
I want to see another scene that shows 3 light bulbs and a button and when I press the button, the first unlit light will come on, with a sound effect playing. For each subsequent button press, the next unlit light will come on and play a sound effect,
So that I can have an element in the scene that encourages repeated interaction.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given that I am viewing the scene,
When I touch the button,
Then the first unlit light will light up followed by a sound effect.

Given that I have pressed the button and a light has lit up,
When I press the button again,
Then the next unlit light will light up followed by a sound effect.

============================

User Story #4
As a reader,
I want to see another scene that shows a machine and a button, and when the button is pressed, the button will animate, play a sound, and then the machine will do 1 of 3 fun things,
So that I can have an element in the scene that encourages interaction.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given that I am viewing the scene,
When I touch the button,
Then the button will animate and play a sound and after the sound plays the machine will choose 1 of 3 fun things to display.
